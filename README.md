## TheSmartLamp
Original idea @ElizabethMorves from a lost repository こんばんは [konbanwa]. With minor additions and rewritten code.

Used [homie](https://github.com/homieiot/homie-esp8266.git) framework which works great with esp32.

> OTA update via MQTT scripts, requires ESP32 with 8 megabytes of flash memory
