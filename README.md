## TheSmartLamp
Original idea @ElizabethMorves from a lost repository こんばんは [konbanwa] (good evening). With minor additions and rewritten code.

Used [homie](https://github.com/homieiot/homie-esp8266.git) framework which works great with esp32.

======================

Opportunities:
* on/off one relay.
* control two LEDs Strip warm/cold lighting.
* check sensors Temperature, Pressure, Humidity.
* ambilight color and 55 lighting effects.
* MQTT management.
* Easy initial setup through the captive portal.
